## Business Task
**Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.**

## Analysis Questions
**Three questions will guide the future marketing program:**

**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?<br>**
**Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<br>**
**How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

| Member        | Casual        |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Travelling mostly during weekdays 7am to 7pm. Short rides for office, school or univerties  | Travelling moslty on weekends during evening Time. Long rides  |

**According to data casual riders using bikes mostly on weekends for long rides. If we can offer them weekends membership cards with discount on ride length,**
**it can help the company to make profit and convert the casual riders to members.<br> **
Promote discount coupons for weekends passes and add banners or do advertisement at those places where casual riders are moslty travelling on bike.**
